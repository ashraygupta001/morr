## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?`

I chooses react to develop frontend of the application because it's quite famous JavaScript library among developers handled by open source community.\
Also react come up with state management facility which help in managing the data without updating the real Dom (as it update in virtual Dom).\
Used Create-react-app so as to get proper folder structure. Although I hadn't used any CSS library as mentioned in the docs.

### `Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?`

I will improve the UI. Also I would like to manage my state with context API and reducers.\

### `What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?`

If given more time I will surely improve the user interface. I will also improve the folder structure adding Context Api for better state management.\
Instead of using create-react-app, I will try to write config files for tools like webpack, babel, prettier, postcss, eslint etc by myself.\
Also I will also follow microservice Architecture and will try to make different small small modules so as to make my applications more modular.easifying solving bugs, easy to test etc.\
Writing better test for the application.\
